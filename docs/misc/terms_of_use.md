### Public Media Platform, Inc.

# API Terms of Use

These PMP API Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the use of the PMP API and bind all Users who use and/or access the PMP API.  By using the PMP API, you agree to be bound by the Terms.  If you do not agree to the Terms, please do not use the PMP API.

The Public Media Platform was organized to distribute digital content (including audio, video, text, and images) from multiple public media entities across a variety of web and mobile platforms.  The PMP API allows stations, websites, and digital platforms to find news, cultural, and educational content produced by participating Content Providers.

## 1. Definitions

**1.1** The “Public Media Platform” or “PMP” is a 501&#40;c)(3) organization providing the service to which these Terms apply.

**1.2** The “PMP API” or “API” is the application programming interface used by the PMP to distribute digital content, and the subject of these Terms.

**1.3** “PMP Services” are the web services provided to Users by the PMP, including but not limited to the PMP API.

**1.4** “API Content” or “Content” is content of any nature, including text, audio, images, video and links thereto, found within the PMP API.

**1.5** A “User” is an account associated with the PMP API, representing an individual or an organization within the context of the API.

**1.6** A “Content Provider” or “Provider” is any User who submits Content to the API.

**1.7** “Content Provider License Terms” are specific additional terms, conditions, and restrictions given by a Content Provider governing the permissible use and access to their API Content.

**1.8** “Intellectual Property Rights” are trademark, servicemark, copyright and patent ownership rights.

## 2. User Registration

**2.1** PMP controls the allocation and designation of User accounts.  Only individuals designated by PMP can create an account to access the PMP API.  Organizations must designate a single individual to establish an account on its behalf.  If you are setting up an account on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so and that you have the authority to bind that organization.

**2.2** Each User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its credentials - including username, password, and client authorizations.  Users may not share, transfer, or authorize others outside their organizations to use their credentials without prior written approval from PMP.  Users are entirely responsible for all activities that occur on or through their account.  Users agree to notify PMP immediately if they become aware of any unauthorized use of their account or have reason to believe that their account is no longer secure.

## 3. API Content Submission

**3.1** Content Providers retain the copyright and other ownership rights in any API Content that they submit through the PMP API and grant Users of the PMP API a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license to display or stream their API Content in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, without payment and without further consent or notice to them.

**3.2** Content Providers may specify additional Content Provider License Terms.  If Content Provider License Terms are  specified, then the Content Provider License Terms take precedence over any provisions in these Terms.  Users agree to comply with all Content Provider License Terms as specified in any given API Content.  Users may not use, copy, reproduce, or distribute the API Content in any other manner.

**3.3** Content Providers warrant and represent that their API Content is not libelous, defamatory, false, obscene, indecent, lewd, pornographic, violent, abusive, threatening, harassing, discriminatory, in violation of the law, harmful to children, in violation of third party privacy rights, or constitutes hate speech or a personal attack.

**3.4** Content Providers warrant and represent that they own or have all necessary rights and permissions to use, distribute, and authorize Users (to the extent permitted by these Terms) to use and distribute any API Content they submit, and that there are no encumbrances or restrictions on the content or its use as contemplated by these Terms.

**3.5** Content Providers may not knowingly submit any Content that contains a virus, worm, Trojan horse or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents, programs or device.

**3.6** PMP does not produce, select, edit, or otherwise control the API Content, and makes no representations as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, reliability, or noninfringement of Content.  Content Providers are solely responsible for any API Content submitted using their account.  PMP does not and cannot review all API Content submitted by Content Providers and is not responsible or liable for any API Content submitted through the PMP API.

**3.7** PMP has the right (but not the obligation) to review, screen, delete, edit, and/or move any API Content that it deems, in its sole discretion, to be in violation of these Terms, or for any other reason, as determined in PMP’s sole discretion.  If PMP has questions about API Content, PMP reserves the right, but not the duty, to contact the Content Provider for further information, including, for example, to verification that the Content Provider owns the copyright or otherwise has the rights to post the Content.

**3.8** PMP reserves the right to apply sponsorship and track usage of any API Content with the explicit permission of the Content Provider.

**3.9** Users must be at least 13 years of age in order to submit API Content.
