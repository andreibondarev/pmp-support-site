# Registration

You need to [register an account](http://support.pmp.io/register) for yourself or your organization to get started with the PMP.  Organizations should use a single API user to access the PMP, to ensure that content permissions are applied consistently for their applications.  If you are already a public media subscriber, your user account may already exist, and you just need to [reset your password](http://support.pmp.io/forgot) to start using the PMP.

If you already have an account, you can [log in](http://support.pmp.io/login) to manage your user.
